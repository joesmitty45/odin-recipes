    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Green bean casserole is an amazing dish, and is commonly found in Thanksgiving dinners. The gooey, warm green bean and sauce mix is accentuated by the perfectly crisp fried onions, and deliciously blend together to make a beautiful taste in your mouth. Now you've made me hungry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans green beans, drained</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can French fried onions</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place green beans and soup in a large microwave-safe bowl. Mix well and heat in the microwave on HIGH until warm (3 to 5 minutes). Stir in 1/2 cup of cheese and heat mixture for another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer green bean mixture to a casserole dish and sprinkle with French fried onions and remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven until the cheese melts and the onions just begin to brown.</li>
        <li>Let cool and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
